Small web-based monitoring dashboard for windows in C and MVC
A small web-based monitoring dashboard for your Windows pc/server writen in C# and MVC + Chart.js.

The dashboard is built using only C# libraries available in the main C# distribution, trying to create a small list of dependencies without the need of installing many packages or libraries.

**Current dependencies**:

- Net Framework 4
- C# MVC 
- AttributeRouting
- SQLite

**Localization**:

- (1) "App_Data\Localization\en-EN.txt" copy this file and translate the language you want to use.
- (2) "App_Data\Setting.ini" LANGUAGE line in the file that you want to use the written language. Example: LANGUAGE=en-EN or LANGUAGE=tr-TR
- (3) Started to use in their own language

**NetDash Settings**

The only settings currently available which you can modify are the refresh rates for the different data tables. There are 3 different refresh settings under *netdash/App_data/Setting.ini* and values are in miliseconds:


* TIME_JS_REFRESH = 30000       #30 seconds
* TIME_JS_REFRESH_LONG = 120000	#120 seconds
* TIME_JS_REFRESH_NET = 2000	#2 seconds

You can modify any of the values to whatever you would like the new refresh rate to be. Restart the webserver after each update to the Setting.ini file.

The tables and the refresh settings are as follows:

* Memory Usage - TIME_JS_REFRESH
* Load Average - TIME_JS_REFRESH
* CPU Usage - TIME_JS_REFRESH
* Traffic Usage - TIME_JS_REFRESH_NET
* Disk Reads/Writes - TIME_JS_REFRESH_NET
* Uptime - TIME_JS_REFRESH_LONG
* Disk Usage - TIME_JS_REFRESH_LONG
* Online Users - TIME_JS_REFRESH_LONG
* Processes - TIME_JS_REFRESH_LONG
* Netstat - TIME_JS_REFRESH_LONG

**Remote data retrieval**
